Learning JavaScript by building projects and practicing core concepts.

Notes App (DOM Manipulation)

My first JavaScript DOM-based project, where I practiced dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling.

What I learned:

Selecting elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll

Handling form submit events

Preventing default page reload using event.preventDefault()

Dynamically creating HTML elements (createElement)

Appending elements to the DOM

Removing elements dynamically using event listeners

Features:

Add notes with a title and description

Notes are created dynamically in the DOM

Delete notes instantly without page reload

Clean form inputs after submission

This project helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML in real time and strengthened my frontend fundamentals.
